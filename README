This version of vanitygen was forked from Samr7's lovely C code,
by funkenstein the dwarf, to make vanity addresses for Woodcoin.

DO NOT USE THIS FORK TO CREATE BITCOIN ADDRESSES ON MAINNET BITCOIN

DO NOT USE THIS FORK TO CREATE ANYTHING BUT WOODCOIN ADDRESSES

Please for the love of God only use the "-W" flag with this software!!! 


The elliptic curve has been globally changed from secp256k1 to prime256v1,
so we are ONLY going to produce valid woodcoin addresses with this code.  

Example of proper use:

Notebook-PC:~/work/temp/vanitygen$ ./vanitygen WWWWW -iW
Set addrtype to woodcoin
